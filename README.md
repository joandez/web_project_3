## Intro

This is a project about traveling across the U.S. from Portland, ME to Portland, OR. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes!

## Project description

For this project, we were provided a **[Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/xM9rNsdK4iNcFJmDZho3Aw/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=500%3A0)** as our creative brief. We're learning how to apply topics covered in Course 2, Sprint 3 of the Practicum by Yandex: Web Developer program, including but not limited to:
* Working with Designs and Specifications
* Responsive Web Design
* CSS Grid Layouts
* Media Queries
* Git Branches

Per our project specifications, I focused on these primary intervals for breakpoints:
* 1280px and higher (standard laptops and beyond)
* From 1024px to 1280px (from a tablet in landscape to a standard laptop)
* From 768px to 1024px (from a tablet in portrait to a tablet in landscape)
* From 425px to 768px (from a large smartphone to a tablet in portrait)
* Up to 425px (mobile devices)

## Requirements
I haven't added browser-specific prefixes for CSS Grid elements, so please view in Chrome 57+ or Safari 10.1+.

## Plans for improvement
Once we learn more about Javascript, we can add functionality to the header's language Links element.
